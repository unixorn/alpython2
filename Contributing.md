# Contributing

First and foremost, thanks for the help, I appreciate all of the contributions.

* Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
* Your PR should pass the Travis checks. If the travis checks show an error that you didn't add, you don't _have_ to fix those errors, though I'll appreciate the help if you do.
* No need to squash commits. It is fine to have multiple commits in a PR.
